  '/images/mobile-logo.webp'
];

self.addEventListener('install', event => {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open(MOBILE_CACHE).then(cache => {
      return cache.addAll(CRITICAL_RESOURCES);
    })
  );
});

// Network-first strategy for mobile
self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  if (event.request.url.includes('/api/')) {
    // API requests: network first with fast timeout
    event.respondWith(
      Promise.race([
        fetch(event.request),
        new Promise((_, reject) => 
          setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('timeout')), 3000)
        )
      ]).catch(() => caches.match(event.request))
    );
  }
});
```

**3. Mobile Form Optimization:**
```html
<!-- Mobile-optimized form inputs -->
<form class="mobile-form">
  <input type="tel" 
         inputmode="numeric" 
         autocomplete="tel"
         placeholder="Phone Number"
         aria-label="Phone Number">
  
  <input type="email" 
         inputmode="email"
         autocomplete="email"
         placeholder="Email Address"
         aria-label="Email Address">
  
  <!-- Minimize typing on mobile -->
  <select name="country" autocomplete="country">
    <option value="US">United States</option>
    <option value="CA">Canada</option>
  </select>
</form>
```
