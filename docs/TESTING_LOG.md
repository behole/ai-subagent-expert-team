## üîß Ongoing Testing Protocols

### Daily Testing (if actively developing)
1. Run `npm run build` to verify compilation
2. Execute `npx ts-node examples/basic-usage.ts` for smoke test
3. Check expert registration count (should be 12)

### Weekly Testing (during active development)
1. Run comprehensive test suite
2. Test all slash commands manually
3. Verify cross-expert collaboration
4. Check performance with various project types

### Release Testing (before major releases)
1. Complete end-to-end testing with all scenarios
2. Performance benchmarking
3. Edge case validation
4. Documentation accuracy verification

### Regression Testing (when adding new features)
1. Ensure existing experts still function
2. Verify orchestration logic unchanged
3. Confirm slash commands still work
4. Test synthesis engine with new combinations

## üìà Performance Benchmarks

### Response Time Targets
- **Simple Projects** (1-3 experts): < 1 second
- **Medium Projects** (4-6 experts): < 2 seconds
