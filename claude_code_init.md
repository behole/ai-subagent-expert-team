# Claude Code Initialization - AI SubAgent Expert Team Project

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
Building an orchestrated team of 12 AI SubAgents that function as expert consultants, providing intelligent feedback on creative work across multiple domains. Analysis-first approach - experts provide professional insights rather than generating deliverables.

## SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### Hub-and-Spoke Model
- **Central Orchestrator:** Project Context Specialist coordinates expert team
- **12 Specialized Experts:** Deep domain expertise with analytical frameworks  
- **Smart Activation:** Auto-determines relevant experts + manual slash commands (@expertName)
- **Synthesis Engine:** Combines multi-expert insights into actionable feedback

### Expert Activation Philosophy
- **Always Active:** Project Context Specialist (Alex Chen) - orchestrates all projects
- **Auto-Activate:** Experts triggered by project type, content, and requirements
- **Manual Override:** @expertName commands for direct consultation
