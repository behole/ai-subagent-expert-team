## Framework Additions

### 7. Confidence Scoring System
**Decision:** Uncertainty Acknowledgment (Option D)

- **Benefits:** 
  - Builds trust through honest uncertainty acknowledgment
  - Helps identify when additional research/experts needed
  - Shows specific boundaries of expertise
  - Supports interactive consultation process

  - "Let me research current AR interface standards and get back to you"
  - Leverages external APIs, databases, and research tools
- **Network Expansion (C):**
  - System suggests adding new permanent or temporary experts for specialized needs
  - Builds library of specialist consultants for specific niches
  - "This requires blockchain UI expertise - should I bring in a crypto design specialist?"
- **Hybrid Benefits:**
  - Immediate research capability for knowledge gaps
  - Long-term network building for recurring specialized needs
  - Flexible response to both one-off and ongoing expertise requirements
- **Implementation:** Experts attempt research first, suggest specialist addition for complex/recurring needs
